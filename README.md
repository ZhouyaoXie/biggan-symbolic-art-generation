This is the project repository for CMU 10-615 Art and Machine Learning Project 2. In this project, we fine-tuned a BigGAN model to generate symbolic and abstract paintings using the [WikiArt dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/wikiart-gangogh-creating-art-gan).

The code in this repository is based on [this implementation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fbyA6RPusn2PiJagWwM1eanZLYPB2N8naEBR83Q8BHU/edit?usp=sharing) of the study
[Image Generation from Small Datasets via Batch Statistics Adaptation](https://github.com/nogu-atsu/small-dataset-image-generation).

Our report is included in this repository. You can also check out our report via [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fbyA6RPusn2PiJagWwM1eanZLYPB2N8naEBR83Q8BHU/edit?usp=sharing).
